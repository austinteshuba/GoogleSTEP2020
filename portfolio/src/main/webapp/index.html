          Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.

      <a href="https://github.com/austinteshuba" target="_blank">Github</a>

      <p> 
          I'm a rising 3rd-year software engineering student at Western University.

      <p>
          I’m also a technologist knowledgeable in web development with Angular, 
          iOS development with Swift, data analysis and ML with Python, algorithms, 
          object oriented design, and much more.

      <p>
          Most importantly, I’m a curious person and a lightening fast learner. 
          Whether I’m mastering web development to complete a pressing project at Deloitte, 
          or figuring out Twilio and Microsoft Azure in 24 hours at MHacks, 
          I always approach new problems with a positive attitude and relentless determination.

      <p> 
          If you're solving big problems with even bigger impacts, please reach out!
          I'd love to chat more about how I can help.

      <p>
          What am I doing right now?
      </p>
