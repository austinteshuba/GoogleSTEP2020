      <p>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio</p>

      <p> I'm a rising 3rd-year software engineering student at Western University. </p>

      <p> I’m also a technologist knowledgeable in web development with Angular, 
          iOS development with Swift, data analysis and ML with Python, algorithms, 
          object oriented design, and much more.
      </p>

      <p> Most importantly, I’m a curious person and a lightening fast learner. 
          Whether I’m mastering web development to complete a pressing project at Deloitte, 
          or figuring out Twilio and Microsoft Azure in 24 hours at MHacks, 
          I always approach new problems with a positive attitude and relentless determination.
      </p>

      <p> If you're solving big problems with even bigger impacts, please reach out!
          I'd love to chat more about how I can help.
